# DagsHub OpenAPI 3.0 definition

## Dev instruction if you need to change the API:

1) Download VS Code
2) Install the **OpenAPI (Swagger) Editor** extension
3) Open `spec.yaml` then click on the "Split preview" button (with the magnifying glass)

Once the API changes, client libraries are regenerated and the pull request to [the repository with the clients](https://github.com/DagsHub/api-clients) is made
